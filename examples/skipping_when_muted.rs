// This example demonstrates the SkipWhenMuted optimization. This iterator does
// not advance its source iterator when the volume is muted which can save
// unnecessary work in the iterator chain when nothing would be audible anyway.
//
// When the volume is un-muted again, it skips forward using the seek parameter
// of a reusable buffer so that playback resumes as though it had been playing
// while muted. For a simpler version that doesn't do this, see PauseWhenMuted.
//
// The seek_ratio is needed if the number of channels and sample rate differs
// between the point when the ReusableBuffer iterator is used and the point when
// the SkipWhenMuted iterator is used. For every 1 sample advanced later in the
// chain, it needs to know how far to advance the ReusableBuffer.
//
// The peek parameter is optional (0 to disable) and instructs SkipWhenMuted to
// peek at its source iterator every n output samples to see if it has finished.
// This can help reduce load in AudioMixer because otherwise the SkipWhenMuted
// iterator would never finish if it stays muted forever. If this happens a lot,
// these zombied iterators can start to slow AudioMixer down.
//
// If you want to resume when un-muted again, see PauseWhenMuted.
// If you want to stop immediately when muted, see StopWhenMuted.
