// This example reads from an ogg file, plays it at half pitch through the
// default audio device and records the result to a wav file.
//
// The AudioMixer::start_recording method takes a closure. Whenever the audio
// device requests the next chunk of audio to be played, this chunk is passed
// into the closure with some extra metadata (e.g. elapsed_time). This example
// then uses the hound crate to write this uncompressed audio to a wav file.
//
// AudioMixer does not implement audio recording as an iterator, instead opting
// to handle it specially as a first-class method. This is because the point at
// which .next() is called on the iterators isn't necessarily the point when
// these samples are played on the audio device. AudioMixer tries to give an
// accurate representation of the real playback time in the elapsed_time field.
